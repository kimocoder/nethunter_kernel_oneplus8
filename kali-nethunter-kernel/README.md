## Installation 
Clone this repository into your kernel source tree, e.g.  

``` bash
cd android_kernel_oneplus_sm8150
git clone https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/nethunter/build-scripts/kali-nethunter-kernel
```

Cd into kali-nethunter-kernel, open "config" and make sure that you are happy with all the settings.  
Important: Changes should not be made in this file. Copy it accross to "local.config" and delete everything except the parameters you would like to change. Change those parameters and save it.  
The settings in "local.config" overwrites "config" but will itself not be overwritten by updates.
